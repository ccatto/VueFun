## Todo: research

- create better directory structure but for now this simplicity UI will do maybe create atoms; molecules; organisms for atomic design later;

- looks similar to react components;
- maybe research some component libraries these look popular:
- [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
