## August 2025 

This is a Vue starter app developed by Chris Catto to get used to Vue and have some fun;

Vue topics:
* templates
* components
* Routing
* layouts

This app includes some fundamental node packages such as:
* Typescript
* Tailwind 
* eslint
* prettier
* customized favicon orange H
* setup some alias for a few directories

### Todos 
* a bunch HA
* I won&apos;t be able to get to all these but just a list of some areas I want to explore more
* authorization and authentication - get used to how Vue does this;
* State - explore this Vue store called Pinia to start and maybe others if needed;
* update tailwind to v4 currently v3 should update v4 but wanted to focus on Vue not tailwind setup

This is open source project nothing propriety here;
